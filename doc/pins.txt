setgpio 2 ALT0 UP # I2C communication DAC chip
setgpio 3 ALT0 UP # I2C communication DAC chip
setgpio 6 INPUT DEFAULT # do not use, reserved for Master clock
setgpio 18 ALT0 DEFAULT # I2S
setgpio 19 ALT0 DEFAULT # I2S
setgpio 20 ALT0 DEFAULT # I2S
setgpio 21 ALT0 DEFAULT # I2S

That means, GPIO 2,3,6 and 18-21 are used.
Note that this are the GPIO numbers, NOT the pin numbers. These pins are used for the Digi+ and the DAC+

GPIO2 and 3 can be used also for other I2C devices, but not as general-purpose-IOs.

PiTFT TOUCHSCREEN
-----------------
This design uses the hardware SPI pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CE0, CE1) as well as GPIO #25 and
#24. All other GPIO are unused. Since we had a tiny bit of space, there's 4 spots for optional slim
tactile switches wired to four GPIOs, that you can use if you want to make a basic user interface.
For example, you can use one as a power on/off button.
We bring out GPIO #23, #22, #21, and #18 to the four switch locations!
