There is an ugly hack that will probably work.
Get the UART talking at whatever rate it supports (e.g. 38400). 
The input to the UART is a 3MHz clock. You can vary that clock with the 
config.txt parameter init_uart_clock.

So, you want to make that 3MHz x 31250 / 38400.

So add to config.txt
init_uart_clock=2441406
